# Brief description of project
Understanding that many people wish to have a healthier diet and track what they are eating but find it inconvenient to do so, we want to build a practical, functional spoon that can do all that for us automatically. 

The implementation of this spoon required the following fields of knowledge:  embedded systems - sensors & actuators, cloud computing for the server, data visualization for the dashboard and data science/deep learning for image recognition.
